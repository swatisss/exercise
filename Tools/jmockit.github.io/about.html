   <a href="#">About the JMockit Testing Toolkit</a>
</h1>
<p>
   JMockit is open source software licensed under the
   <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT License</a>.
   It includes mocking APIs and other tools for use in <em>developer testing</em>, that is, tests written by developers
   using a testing framework such as <a href="http://junit.org">JUnit</a> or <a href="http://testng.org">TestNG</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The toolkit was created mainly as an attempt to overcome certain limitations found in "conventional"
   <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">mocking</a> tools, which prevented the creation
   of unit tests for code designed according to well-established OO practices.
   Another goal was to provide simpler and more succinct APIs for writing developer tests.
   In addition, and differently from other testing tools which specifically target the use of mocks, JMockit also
   includes other tools designed to support the creation of large test suites.
</p>

<h2 id="internalWorkings">
   <a href="#internalWorkings">How it works</a>
</h2>
<p>
   Internally, the Java SE 6 bytecode instrumentation feature (the
   <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html"
      >java.lang.instrument</a> package) is used extensively.
   For the reading and in-memory generation of modified bytecode arrays, the <a href="http://asm.objectweb.org">ASM</a>
   library is used.
</p>
<p>
   Mocking features mostly use the JVM's ability to <em>redefine</em> classes that have already been loaded, as exposed
   through the <code>java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation#redefineClasses(ClassDefinition...)</code> method.
   This method uses the same mechanism behind the "hotswap" feature commonly used while debugging Java code, which
   allows a new version of a class to take the place of its current version in a running JVM.
</p>
<p>
   Whenever a class to be mocked is found in the course of a test run, it has its current bytecode definition
   temporarily modified, so that the regular behavior of methods and constructors can be replaced with mock behavior, as
   specified in a test.
   As soon as the test is completed, the class has its bytecode restored, and its original behavior is resumed.
   This process repeats itself for the next test, whenever needed as specified in test code through the mocking API.
</p>

<h2 id="conventionalTools">
   <a href="#conventionalTools">Conventional tools for mock objects</a>
</h2>
<p>
   The JMockit approach is an alternative to the conventional use of "mock objects" as provided by tools such as
   <a href="http://easymock.org">EasyMock</a>, <a href="http://jmock.org">jMock</a>, and
   <a href="http://mockito.org">Mockito</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Such tools are based on the dynamic generation of implementation classes (through
   <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html">java.lang.reflect.Proxy</a>, when
   given an interface to be mocked) and subclasses (through <a href="http://cglib.sourceforge.net">CGLIB</a>, when given
   a non-final class to be mocked).
   This particular mocking implementation technique, in which a subclass with overriding mock methods is created,
   carries some penalties: <code>final</code> classes, constructors, and non-overridable methods simply <em>cannot</em>
   be mocked; even worse, when mocking a non-final class which happens to contain <code>final</code> methods, these
   tools will silently ignore them, often surprising users.
   Most importantly, however, these limitations mean that dependencies of code under test (that is, the objects of other
   classes on which a given class under test depends) must be controlled by the tests, so that mock instances can be
   passed to the clients of those dependencies;
   that is, dependencies cannot simply be instantiated with the <code>new</code> operator in the client class.
</p>
<p>
   Ultimately, the technical limitations of conventional mocking tools impose the following design restrictions on
   production code:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      Each class which may need to be mocked in a test must either implement a separate interface or not be
      <code>final</code>.
   </li>
   <li>
      The dependencies of each class to be tested must either be obtained through configurable instance creation methods
      (factories or a <em>Service Locator</em>), or be exposed for
      <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">dependency injection</a>.
      Otherwise, tests won't be able to pass mock implementations of dependencies to code under test.
   </li>
   <li>
      Since only non-final instance methods can be mocked, classes to be unit tested in isolation from their
      dependencies cannot call any <code>static</code> or <code>final</code> methods on said dependencies, nor
      directly instantiate them.
   </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="productionCode">
   <a href="#productionCode">Design considerations for production code</a>
</h2>
<p>
   The problem with imposing restrictions on the design of production code is that there <em>are</em> good reasons for
   making classes and methods <code>final</code>, for directly obtaining instances of collaborators with the
   <code>new</code> operator, and for using APIs containing <code>static</code> methods.
   There is nothing inherently wrong with using these three Java language keywords, after all.
</p>

<h3 id="final">
   <a href="#final">Use of <code>final</code></a>
</h3>
<p>
   Declaring classes or methods <code>final</code> communicates the design decision that they are not intended for
   extension by subclassing.
   For example, in a correct application of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern">Template
   Method</a> design pattern, the "template" method itself (which implements an algorithm calling one or more
   overridable methods) must <em>not</em> be overridable.
   Also, from the point of view of API design, <code>final</code> classes are the only ones which can be safely evolved;
   otherwise, you risk running into the <em>fragile base-class</em> problem.
   For more on this, see the following articles:
   <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2073649/core-java/why-extends-is-evil.html">Why extends is evil</a>,
   <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill18.htm">Virtuality</a>.
</p>
<p>
   In practice, most classes and methods in an application or even in a reusable class library are not designed with
   extension by subclassing in mind, so it makes sense to declare them as <code>final</code>; probably that's why most
   other OO languages (C++, C#, etc.) make all methods non-overridable by default.
</p>
<p>
   Another benefit of making Java classes or methods <code>final</code> is that a good static analysis tool will be able
   to provide more useful feedback.
   The code inspections associated with the use of <code>final</code> in IntelliJ IDEA, for example, led me numerous
   times to simplify and even eliminate unused parts of the code base, when developing large business applications.
   (For the curious, some of the relevant inspections are: "Class structure: 'protected' member in 'final' class",
   "Declaration redundancy: redundant throws declaration", and "Initialization issues: overridable method call during
   object construction".)
</p>
<p>
   For an authoritative discussion on design for extension (which defends the judicious use of <code>final</code> for
   classes and methods), see "Item 17: Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it" in the
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683">Effective Java</a> book.
   Another book which strongly recommends the use of <code>final</code> for classes and methods is
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-API-Design-Confessions-Framework/dp/1430209739">Practical API Design</a>
   (see "Make Everything Final", in chapter 5).
   Yet another relevant book is <a href="http://www.apibook.com/blog">API Design for C++</a>, which is also largely
   applicable to Java (see sections "2.3.2 Add Virtual Functions Judiciously" and "4.6.3 Using Inheritance").
   The site for this last book points to several interesting articles, including
   <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=142428">Java API Design Guidelines</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Personally, I consider the choice by the Java language designers to make non-private instance methods overridable
   <em>by default</em> a mistake, one which was probably influenced by a mentality typical until the 1990's that the
   more you can inherit, the better.
   Personal experience, however, shows two things that discredit that position: 1) in most cases, Java programmers
   simply take the easy route and leave all classes and methods as non-final, without consideration for API design
   questions (just like for languages with the "<code>virtual</code>" keyword, where most methods end up as
   non-overridable simply because it was the default - the difference here, of course, being that this usually is the
   right choice); 2) often, when a programmer decides to create a subclass for a non-final Java class, it is done only
   as a "hack" intended to arbitrarily change the behavior of some method, without any consideration to object-oriented
   design principles such as the <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/lsp.pdf">Liskov Substitution
   Principle</a> (LSP), or the recommendation to "<cite>Favor object composition over class inheritance</cite>"
   (<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignPatternsBook">Design Patterns</a>, page 20).
</p>

<h3 id="new">
   <a href="#new">Use of <code>new</code></a>
</h3>
<p>
   Directly instantiating dependencies with <code>new</code> facilitates the use of stateful objects.
   In OO design, objects normally are not stateless.
   However, when dependencies are obtained or injected through external means (such as a "Service Locator" or a DI
   framework) there is a tendency to make them stateless, and with a single global instance.
   Such a practice leads to code that is more procedural and less object oriented.
   Of course, this criticism applies to dependencies whose interfaces have only one implementation in production code,
   or when the selection of an implementation between many would not benefit from external configuration (for example,
   people typically instantiate <code>List</code> implementations directly, even if they code to the abstract
   interface only); situations where one implementation <em>must</em> be selected through external configuration tend to
   be quite rare in practice.
</p>
<p>
   Related to this issue, I think, there is a widely observed misunderstanding of just what the phrase "<cite>Program to
   an interface, not an implementation</cite>" (from the famous "Design Patterns" book, page 18) actually means.
   Many seem to think that one should <em>create</em> a new separate Java interface (or abstract class) for any concrete
   class which is being created or doesn't yet implement one.
   In reality, it was only meant as a recommendation to avoid declaring variables, fields, parameters, or return types
   as the implementation type <em>when an abstract type already exists</em> (for example, don't declare variables of
   type <code>ArrayList</code> if all you need is a <code>List</code>).
   The "Effective Java" book mentioned above also discusses this topic, in "Item 52: Refer to objects by their
   interfaces".
</p>
<p>
   Another bad motivation to avoid the use of <code>new</code> may simply be an unreasonable fear of getting "too much"
   garbage collection.
   The truth, however, is that JVM implementations are (and have been for many years) very good at efficiently managing
   short-lived objects.
   Using single-instance classes as a rudimentary object caching mechanism is a terrible use of the Java platform.
   From my experience, this practice not only leads to anti-OO code but also to big, un-cohesive, stateless classes with
   many methods, the exact opposite of small, cohesive, and stateful classes which are what true objects are about.
</p>

<h3 id="static">
   <a href="#static">Use of <code>static</code></a>
</h3>
<p>
   The use of classes containing only <code>static</code> methods is the best choice when none of the methods operate on
   any state (for example, the <code>Math</code> class), or the actual state is stored in a separate context object,
   such as the HTTP request context or the persistence context.
   For this last situation, consider an application that has a persistence subsystem which provides access to a
   relational database.
   One possibility is to inject instances of work unit objects (an Hibernate <code>Session</code>, or a JPA
   <code>EntityManager</code>) wherever they are needed, and use the persistence API directly.
   A better approach, in my experience, is to use a <em>static facade</em> which encapsulates all access from the
   application to the persistence subsystem.
   The benefits of this are many, not the least of which is that it actually provides <em>more</em> flexibility than the
   more direct, instance-based, approach, while providing a tight and easily accessible client API.
</p>
<p>
   Another recommended usage of static methods is presented in "Item 1: Consider static factory methods instead of
   constructors", again in the "Effective Java" book.
</p>

<h2 id="testability">
   <a href="#testability">Testability</a>
</h2>
<p>
   The limitations found in conventional mocking tools have come to be associated with the idea of "untestable code".
   Often, we see the restrictions resulting from those limitations considered as inevitable, or even as something that
   could be beneficial.
   The JMockit toolkit, which breaks away from these limitations and restrictions, shows that in fact there is no such
   thing as truly untestable code. There is, of course, code that is harder to test because it is too complicated and
   convoluted, lacks cohesion, and so on and so forth.
</p>
<p>
   Therefore, by eliminating the technical limitations traditionally involved in the isolation of a unit from its
   dependencies, we get the benefit that no artificial design restrictions must be imposed on production code for the
   sake of unit testing.
   Additionally, it becomes possible to write unit tests for legacy code, without the need for any prior adaptation or
   refactoring.
   The ability to create automated regression tests for existing code before <em>refactoring</em> it is extremely
   valuable, as implied by the very <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DefinitionOfRefactoring.html">definition</a>
   of the term.
   In short, with a less restrictive mock testing tool the <em>testability</em> of production code becomes less of an
   issue, giving developers more freedom to use the language and more design choices when creating new code, while
   facilitating the initial creation of tests for legacy code.
</p>
<p>
   Another way of thinking about testability is to differentiate between <em>intrinsic</em> and <em>extrinsic</em>
   testability.
   In the first case, we can conclude that whatever makes the code more or less <em>maintainable</em> also makes it more
   or less easily testable, and vice-versa.
   For example, methods with higher <em>cyclomatic complexity</em> (basically, the number of different execution paths
   through the method) require more tests to be fully covered, while at the same time being more difficult to understand
   and change; in other words, intrinsic testability is not particularly useful as a separate measure for code quality,
   if it is nothing more than <em>maintainability</em>.
   In the second case, <em>extrinsic testability</em>, we are not really considering properties of the production code,
   but instead properties of the <em>tools</em> used to <em>test</em> that code.
   Therefore, when a tool for testing code in isolation provides an easy to use API that is able to deal with
   <em>all</em> possible isolation scenarios, such extrinsic concerns for testability completely disappear.
</p>

<h2 id="coverage">
   <a href="#coverage">Code Coverage</a>
</h2>
<p>
   In addition to mocking APIs, the JMockit toolkit includes its own code coverage tool,
   <strong>JMockit Coverage</strong>.
   This tool aims to provide the following benefits.
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      Bytecode modification performed only at runtime, therefore avoiding the creation of undesirable files.
      No extra source or class files are created, and no coverage data file is generated unless explicitly requested.
      The only files created or modified are those that the user really wants as the desired output.
   </li>
   <li>
      Running tests with JMockit Coverage does not require the use of any particular command line script, Ant task,
      Maven plugin, or IDE-specific plugin.
      The tool applies the idea of convention over configuration, trying to make it as easy as possible for the
      developer to run tests with code coverage: by simply adding one jar file to the classpath, and optionally
      specifying certain initialization parameters to the JVM (system properties settable with "<code>-D</code>" or its
      Ant/Maven equivalent).
   </li>
   <li>
      No need to specify which classes should be considered for coverage and which should not (by default, as they can
      be explicitly specified if needed).
      All code under test will automatically be analyzed for coverage.
      Specifically, the tool will gather coverage data for all production code executed by the test suite, excluding
      classes defined inside jar files (on the assumption that such code belongs to libraries used by the code under
      test).
   </li>
   <li>
      An HTML report and/or a serialized output file can be easily generated at the end of each test run.
      The first requires no extra configuration as it is the default form of coverage output; the second only requires
      setting the "<code>coverage-output</code>" system property.
      For the generation of the HTML report, Java source files are automatically searched in all "src" directories
      under the working directory.
   </li>
   <li>
      In code coverage reports, each line of production code can be accurately linked to the lines
      in test code which caused their execution, for each individual execution of each line of code.
      (However, this feature is inactive by default, because of the higher runtime cost and the larger resulting HTML
      report.)
   </li>
   <li>
      Besides a <em>line coverage</em> metric, a <em>path coverage</em> metric is also made available.
      Both metrics are calculated and shown at the source file, package, and global levels.
      For path coverage, each possible path through a method or constructor can be interactively displayed in the HTML
      report.
   </li>
   <li>
      <em>Intra-line</em> coverage is provided, with the appropriate red/green coloring in the HTML report for each
      conditionally executed line segment.
   </li>
</ol>
<p>
   In short, the two main differentiating factors for JMockit Coverage are that 1) it generates the coverage report as
   easily as possible and without depending on special conditions or requiring specific plugins for Java IDEs or build
   tools; and 2) it provides newer and more sophisticated <em>coverage metrics</em>, such as path coverage and
   true line coverage.
