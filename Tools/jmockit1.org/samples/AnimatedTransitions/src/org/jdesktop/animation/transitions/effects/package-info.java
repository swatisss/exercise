/**
 * This package contains the built-in effects used by the Animated Transitions library.
 * <p/>
 * Some of these effects, such as {@link org.jdesktop.animation.transitions.effects.Move},
 * {@link org.jdesktop.animation.transitions.effects.Scale}, {@link org.jdesktop.animation.transitions.effects.FadeIn},
 * and {@link org.jdesktop.animation.transitions.effects.FadeOut} are used automatically by the library, based on which
 * transition type a component undergoes during a transition.
 * These effects, and the others in this package, are available for use by applications, either on their own or in
 * combination with other effects by using {@link org.jdesktop.animation.transitions.effects.CompositeEffect}.
 * See {@link org.jdesktop.animation.transitions.TransitionType} for more information on using custom effects.
